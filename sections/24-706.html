      of the notice and plan approval process is to avoid situations where more than one group seeks to use the same space at the same time. Early submission gives the Chief of Police or his or her designee and the applicant the maximum time to resolve
      any issues that may arise, and minimizes the possibility that an approved plan will already have been issued to another group for the desired time and place. It also provides the Metropolitan Police Department and other District agencies the ability
