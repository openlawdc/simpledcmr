                    <span class="" style="">The leave provisions of the DCFMLA are wholly distinct from the reasonable accommodation obligations of employers covered under the ADA and the DCHRA. The purpose of the DCFMLA and federal FMLA is to make leave available to eligible employees and
      employers within its coverage, and not to limit already existing rights and protections. An employer shall therefore provide leave under whichever statutory provision provides the greater rights to employees.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">1620.7 If an employee is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA, the employer must make reasonable accommodations, barring undue hardship, in accordance with the ADA. At the same time, the employer must afford an employee
      his or her DCFMLA and federal FMLA rights. The ADA’s “disability” and DCFMLA and federal FMLA’s “serious health condition” are different concepts, and must be analyzed separately. DCFMLA entitles eligible employees to sixteen (16) weeks of medical
      leave in any twenty-four (24)-month period due to their own serious health condition, whereas the ADA allows an indeterminate amount of medical leave, barring undue hardship, as a reasonable accommodation.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">1620.8 The DCFMLA and federal FMLA require employers to maintain employees’ group health plan coverage during DCFMLA and FMLA leave on the same conditions as coverage would have been provided if the employee had been continuously employed during the
      leave period. However, ADA does not require maintenance of health insurance unless other employees receive health insurance during leave under the same circumstances. When evaluating a situation where both the DCFMLA or federal FMLA and the ADA
      apply to an individual, the law that provides the greater right or benefit to the individual shall be applied. (See 29 CFR § 825.702 for specific examples of the interaction of the federal FMLA with the ADA.)</span>

                    <span class="" style="">1620.9 Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the DCHRA, an employer shall provide the same benefits for women who are pregnant as the employer provides to other employees with short-term disabilities. Because Title VII does not require
      employees to be employed for a certain period of time to be protected, an employee employed for less than twelve (12) months by the employer (and, therefore, not an “eligible” employee under DCFMLA) may not be denied maternity leave if the employer
      normally provides short-term disability benefits or the ability to take similar periods of medical leave to employees with the same tenure who are experiencing other short-term disabilities.</span>
