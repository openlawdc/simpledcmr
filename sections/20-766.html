                    <span class="" style="">Inline vapor cleaning machines shall beequipped with: Â (a) Either a fully enclosed design, or aworking and downtime mode cover that completely covers the cleaningmachine openings when in place, is free of cracks, holes, and otherdefects, and can
      be readily opened or closed without disturbing thevapor zone; Â (b) A safety switch (thermostat and condenserflow switch) that shuts off the sump heat if the coolant is notcirculating; Â (c) Sides that result in a freeboard ratiogreater than or
      equal to seventy-five one hundredths (0.75); Â(d) A vapor up control switch; Â (e) An automated partshandling system that moves the parts or parts baskets at a speed ofeleven feet (11 ft.) or three and four tenths meters (3.4 m.) perminute or less
      when the parts are entering or exiting the vaporzone. If the parts basket or parts being cleaned occupy more thanfifty percent (50%) of the solvent/air interface area, the speed ofthe parts basket or parts shall not exceed three feet per minute
      (3ft./min.); Â (f) A device that shuts off the sump heat if thesump liquid solvent level drops to the sump heater coils; Â(g) A vapor level control device that shuts off the sump heat ifthe vapor level in the vapor cleaning machine rises above theheight
      of the primary condenser; Â (h) A permanent,conspicuous label summarizing the operating requirements inÂ§ 766.4; Â (i) A primary condenser; and (j) Eachmachine that uses a lip exhaust shall be designed and operated toroute all collected solvent
      vapors through a properly operated andmaintained carbon adsorber such that the concentration of organicsolvent in the exhaust does not exceed one hundred parts permillion (100 ppm). Â 766.3 The operator of an inline vaporcleaning machine shall use
      one (1) of the following devices orstrategies: Â (a) A freeboard ratio of one (1.0) andsuperheated vapor; Â (b) A freeboard refrigeration deviceoperated to ensure that the chilled air blanket temperature is nogreater than thirty percent (30%) of
      thesolventâ€™s boiling point and a freeboard ratio ofone (1.0); Â (c) Dwell and a freeboard refrigeration deviceoperated to ensure that the chilled air blanket temperature is nogreater than thirty percent (30%) of thesolventâ€™s boiling point. Dwell
      shall be not lessthan thirty-five percent (35%) of the dwell time determined for thepart or parts; or Â (d) Dwell and a carbon adsorber, whichreduces solvent emissions in the exhaust to a level not to exceedone hundred parts per million (100 ppm)
      at any time. Dwell shall benot less than thirty-five percent (35%) of the dwell timedetermined for the part or parts. Â 766.4 Inline vaporcleaning machines shall be operated in accordance with thefollowing procedures: Â (a) Waste solvent, still
      bottoms, andsump bottoms shall be collected and stored in closed containers.The closed containers may contain a device that allows pressurerelief, but does not allow liquid solvent to drain from thecontainer; Â (b) Parts shall be oriented so that
      the solventdrains freely from the parts; (1) Cleaned parts shall be drained atleast fifteen (15) seconds or until dripping ceases, whichever islonger; and (2) Parts having cavities or blind holes shall betipped or rotated while the part is draining;
      Â (c) Partsbaskets or parts shall not be removed from the inline vaporcleaning machine until dripping has ceased; Â (d) Flushing orspraying of parts using a flexible hose or other flushing deviceshall be performed within the vapor zone of the inline
      vaporcleaning machine or within a section of the machine that is notexposed to the ambient air. The solvent spray shall be a solidfluid stream, not an atomized or shower spray; Â (e) Sponges,fabric, wood, leather, paper products, and other absorbentmaterials
      shall not be cleaned in the inline vapor cleaningmachine; Â (f) Spills during solvent transfer and use of theinline vapor cleaning machine shall be cleaned up immediately, andthe wipe rags or other absorbent materials shall be immediatelystored
      in covered containers for disposal or recycling; Â (g)Workplace fans shall not be used near the degreaser opening unlessa higher rate is necessary to meet federal Occupational Safety&amp;#038; Health Administration (OSHA) requirements; (h) During
      startupof the inline vapor cleaning machine the primary condenser shall beturned on before the sump heater; Â (i) During shutdown of theinline vapor cleaning machine, the sump heater shall be turned offand the solvent vapor layer allowed to collapse
      before the primarycondenser is turned off; Â (j) Spraying operations shall bedone in the vapor zone or within a section of the machine that isnot exposed to the ambient air; Â (k) When solvent is added toor drained from the inline vapor cleaning
      machine, the solventshall be transferred using threaded or other leak proof couplingsand the end of the pipe in the solvent sump shall be locatedbeneath the liquid solvent surface; and Â (l) Openings shallbe minimized during operations so that entrances
      and exitssilhouette workloads with an average clearance between the partsand the edge of the degreaser opening of less than ten centimeters(10 cm.) or four inches (4 in.) or less than ten percent (10%) ofthe width of the opening. SOURCE: Notice
