      The Electric Company, as the PJM LSE, shall provide the rights to nomination and make available to the wholesale suppliers all Firm Transmission Rights/Auction Revenue Rights (“FTR/ARRs”) to which it has rights pursuant to the PJM procedures applicable

      as many as four bidding rounds, as specified in the RFP.</span>

      that each supplier will be obligated to supply for the term of the contract regardless of changes in the magnitude of the total load for that SOS Customer Group. The size of the total load may vary from the 50 MW guideline for a particular group
      if the total load associated with a specific SOS Customer Group indicates that such variation is warranted. The Electric Company may alter the target size of the bid blocks by requesting permission to do so at the same time as it informs the Commission
      of its procurement plan, but only if it has reason to believe that the change would lead to more competitive offers.</span>
