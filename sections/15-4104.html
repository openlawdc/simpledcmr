      that each supplier will be obligated to supply for the term of the contract regardless of changes in the magnitude of the total load for that SOS Customer Group. The size of the total load may vary from the 50 MW guideline for a particular group
      if the total load associated with a specific SOS Customer Group indicates that such variation is warranted. The Electric Company may alter the target size of the bid blocks by requesting permission to do so at the same time as it informs the Commission
      of its procurement plan, but only if it has reason to believe that the change would lead to more competitive offers.</span>
