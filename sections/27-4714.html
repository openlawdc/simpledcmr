        the contractor’s work is divided into two (2) phases. During the first, or preconstruction, phase, the builder will work with the architect to ensure that the design is constructible, properly coordinated, and affordable. During the second, or
        construction, phase, the contractor is required to construct the project. At this point, the contractor may be required to provide the Department with a guaranteed maximum price. In order to ensure that costs are properly controlled, the Department
        requires that the contractor bid its fee upfront and that all of the major trade packages be competitively bid by the contractor;</span>
