        appoint a particular judge or judges as the Board Neutral, or to appoint any judge or judges as the Neutral. If, when ADR has been requested for a case that has already been docketed with the Board, as provided in Rule 217.1(a), the parties may
        request that the presiding judge serve as the Board Neutral. In such situation, when the ADR is unsuccessful, (i) if the ADR has involved mediation, the presiding judge shall not retain the case, and (ii) if the ADR has not involved mediation,

                    <span class="" style="">Types of ADR. ADR is not defined by any single procedure or set of procedures. The Board will consider the use of any technique proposed by the parties which is deemed to be fair, reasonable, and in the best interest of the parties, the Board, and
      the resolution of disputes. The following are examples of available techniques:</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Mediation. The Board Neutral, as mediator, aids the parties in settling their case. The mediator engages in ex parte discussions with the parties and facilitates the transmission of settlement offers. Although not authorized to render a decision
        in the dispute, the mediator may discuss with the parties, on a confidential basis, the strengths and weaknesses of their positions. No judge who has participated in discussions about the mediation will participate in a Board decision of the case
        if the ADR is unsuccessful.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Neutral case evaluation. The parties agree to present to the Board Neutral information on which the Board Neutral bases a non-binding, oral, advisory opinion. The manner in which the information is presented will vary from case to case depending
        upon the agreement of the parties. Presentations generally fall between two extremes, ranging from an informal proffer of evidence together with limited argument from the parties to a more formal presentation of oral and documentary evidence and
        argument from counsel, such as through a mini-trial.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Binding decision. One or more Board judges render a decision which, by prior agreement of the parties, is to be binding and non-appealable. As in the non-binding evaluation of a case by a Board Neutral, the manner in which information is presented
        for a binding decision may vary depending on the circumstances of the particular case.</span>
