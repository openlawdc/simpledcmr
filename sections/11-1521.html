                    <span class="" style="">The Foggy Bottom Historic District is a unique resource to the District of Columbia that must be preserved and enhanced. The historic district was designated and included in the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 and 1987, respectively.
      It is characterized by low scale residential structures forming a cohesive neighborhood of modest dwellings. Given the high density development pressures caused by the proximity of the Central Employment Area, George Washington University, medical
      clinics, and hotels, strong protection is needed to retain the historic district’s low-scale residential character, human scale streetscape, and historic character.</span>
