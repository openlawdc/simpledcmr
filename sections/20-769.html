                    <span class="" style="">The operator of a solvent cleaning machinesubject to Â§Â§ 764 through 767 shall conductmonitoring and record keeping as follows: Â (a) If a freeboardrefrigeration device is used to comply with these standards, theowner or operator shall use a thermometer
      or thermocouple tomeasure the temperature at the center of the air blanket during theidling mode. Measurements and recordings shall be made weekly; (b)If a superheated vapor system is used to comply with thesestandards, the owner or operator shall
      use a thermometer orthermocouple to measure the temperature at the center of thesuperheated solvent vapor zone while the solvent cleaning machineis in the idling mode. Measurements and recordings shall be madeweekly; (c) If a cover (working-mode,
      downtime-mode, or idling-modecover) is used to comply with these standards, the owner oroperator shall conduct a visual inspection to determine if thecover opens and closes properly, completely covers the cleaningmachine openings when closed, and
      is free of cracks, holes, andother defects. Observations and recordings shall be made weekly;(d) If dwell is used, the owner or operator shall determine theactual dwell time by measuring the period of time that parts areheld within the freeboard
      area of the solvent cleaning machineafter cleaning. Observations and recordings shall be made monthly;(e) The owner or operator shall determine the hoist speed bymeasuring the time it takes for the hoist to travel a measureddistance. The speed is
      equal to the distance in meters divided bythe time in minutes (meters per minute). Measurements andrecordings shall be made monthly; (f) The owner or operator of abatch vapor or in-line solvent cleaning machine complying usingreduced room draft,
      maintained by controlling room parametersincluding but not limited to redirecting fans, and closing doorsand windows, shall conduct monitoring and record the results asfollows: (1) Initially measure the wind speed within six inches (6in.) above
      the top of the freeboard area of the solvent cleaningmachine in accordance with the following: (A) Determine thedirection of the wind current by slowly rotating a velometer orsimilar device until the maximum speed is located; (B) Orient avelometer
      in the direction of the wind current at each of the fourcorners of the machine; (C) Record the reading for each corner; and(D) Average the values obtained at each corner and record theaverage wind speed; (2) Record the room parameters establishedduring
      the initial compliance test to achieve the reduced roomdraft; (3) Quarterly monitor the wind speed in accordance withsubparagraph (f)(1) of this section; and (4) Weekly monitor theroom parameters as specified in this section; (g) If an enclosure,full
      or partial, is used to achieve reduced room draft, the owneror operator shall conduct an initial monitoring test and,thereafter, monthly monitoring tests of the wind speed within theenclosure by slowly rotating a velometer inside the entrance to
      theenclosure until the maximum speed is located and record the maximumwind speed. The owner or operator shall also conduct a monthlyvisual inspection of the enclosure to determine if it is free ofcracks, holes, and other defects; and (h) If a carbon
      adsorber isused to comply with these standards, the owner or operator shallmeasure and record the concentration of halogenated HAP solvent inthe exhaust of the carbon adsorber weekly with a colorimetricdetector tube; (1) This test shall be conducted
      while the solventcleaning machine is in the working mode and is venting to thecarbon adsorber; (2) The exhaust concentration shall be determinedusing a colorimetric detector tube designed to measure aconcentration of one hundred parts per million
      (100 ppm) by volumeof solvent in air to an accuracy of plus or minus twenty-five partsper million (25 ppm) by volume; and (3) The concentration shall bedetermined through a sampling port for monitoring within theexhaust outlet that is easily accessible
      and located at least eight(8) stack or duct diameters downstream and two (2) stack or ductdiameters upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend,expansion, contraction, or outlet; downstream from no other inlet.SOURCE: Notice of Final Rulemaking
