      A sells his entire one-fifth (1/5) interest on November 20, 1989. B sells his entire interest on May 18, 1990, and C cells his entire interest on November 10, 1990. All the transfers made within the twelve (12) month period that concluded on November
      10, 1990, shall be aggregated to determine whether a controlling interest has been transferred. Accordingly, since more than fifty percent (50%) of X corporation’s stock was transferred within a twelve (12) month period, X corporation must record

      constitutes a transfer of a controlling interest. During the period from August 31, 1989, through May 15, 1990, X corporation’s only asset was real property located in the District. In July, 1990, X corporation acquired non-real property assets,
      the value of which comprised fifty percent (50%) of X corporation’s total asset value. During the period from August 31, 1989, through August 30, 1990, X corporation derived more than fifty percent (50%) of its gross receipts from income generated
      by real property located in the District. The transfer of C’s stock to D on August 30, 1990, will subject X corporation to the recordation tax, because at the time of the transfer, X was an entity subject to the recordation tax based on the income
      test. If during the period from August 1, 1989, through August 30, 1990, X corporation did not derive more than fifty percent (50%) of its gross receipts from income generated by real property located in the District, then the transfer of C’s stock
      to D on August 30, 1990, would not be subject to the tax because X corporation did not derive more than fifty percent (50%) of its gross income from property located in the District nor did it meet the eighty percent (80%) asset test on the date
      of the transfer of the controlling interest.</span>
