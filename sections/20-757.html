      standards specified inÂ§ 752 or the Certification Requirements Specified inâ€œCP-501, Certification Procedure for PortableFuel Containers and Spill-Proof Spouts,â€ adopted byCARB July 26, 2006, including any subsequent amendments. 757.5 Amanufacturer
      shall submit an application in writing to theDepartment for an innovative product exemption according to thefollowing requirements: (a) The application must include thesupporting documentation that quantifies the emissions from theinnovative product,
      including the actual physical test methods usedto generate the data; (b) The applicant must provide anyinformation necessary to enable the Department to establishenforceable conditions for granting the exemption; and (c) Allinformation including

      a decision; (b) An applicant may submitadditional supporting documentation before a decision has beenreached; and (c) The Department shall notify the applicant of thedecision in writing and specify such terms and conditions that arenecessary to
      ensure that emissions from use of the product willmeet the performance standards specified in Â§ 752, andthat such emissions reductions can be enforced. 757.8 In grantingan innovative product exemption for a portable fuel container orspout, the
      Department shall specify the test methods fordetermining conformance to the conditions established, which mayinclude criteria for reproducibility, accuracy, and sampling andlaboratory procedures. 757.9 For any portable fuel container orspout for
      which an innovative product exemption has been grantedpursuant to this section, the manufacturer shall notify theDepartment in writing at least thirty (30) days before themanufacturer changes a productâ€™s design,delivery system, or other factors
