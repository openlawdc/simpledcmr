      then a new rehabilitation effort should be considered. Post-employment services are to be provided under an amended individualized plan for employment; thus, a re-determination of eligibility is not required. The provision of post-employment services
      is subject to the same requirements as the provision of any other vocational rehabilitation service. Post-employment services are available to assist an individual to maintain employment, e.g., the individual&amp;#8217;s employment is jeopardized
      because of conflicts with supervisors or coworkers, and the individual needs mental health services and counseling to maintain the employment; to regain employment, e.g., the individual&amp;#8217;s job is eliminated through reorganization and new
      placement services are needed; and to advance in employment, e.g., the employment is no longer consistent with the individual&amp;#8217;s strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice.</span>
