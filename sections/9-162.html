                    <span class="" style="">Worldwide reporting. The member or members of the combined group engaged in a unitary business may elect to determine their apportioned share of the aggregate taxable net income or loss derived from the unitary business pursuant to a worldwide election
      under which each member shall take into account the income and apportionment factors of all the members, wherever located, includible in the combined group. If the members of a combined group do not make this election, each member shall determine
      its apportioned share of such income on a water’s-edge basis.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Mechanics for making the worldwide election. A worldwide election shall be made by the designated agent of the combined group. The election shall be made on an election form and shall be attached to an original, timely filed return. The election,
      to be valid, must indicate, in the manner that the Chief Financial Officer requires, that every entity that is a member of the combined group has agreed to be bound by such election. This election must include an agreement by each member of the
      group that such election shall apply to any member that subsequently enters the group and an agreement that each member continues to be bound by the election in the event that such member is subsequently the subject of a reverse acquisition described
      in Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-75(d)(3).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Effect of election in subsequent tax years. A worldwide election shall be binding for and applicable to the taxable year for which it is made and for the next nine taxable years. Any person entering the unitary combined group after the year of the
      election shall be deemed to have consented to the application of the election and to have waived any objection thereto. Reverse acquisition rules based on the federal rules set forth in Treas. Reg. § 1.1502-75(d)(3) shall be applied in determining
      whether a person is bound by a worldwide election in fact patterns described in such rules.</span>
