      A regimen of continuing treatment such as the taking of over-the-counter medications, bed rest, or similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a health care provider is not, by itself, sufficient to constitute continuing treatment
      for purposes of DCFMLA leave.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Nothing in this section shall require an employer to provide paid medical leave. Should an employee wish to use paid medical, sick, vacation, personal, or compensatory leave which the employee has accrued, the employee may use such paid leave, provided
      that it otherwise meets the employer’s requirements for the taking of such paid leave. Any paid medical, sick, vacation, personal, or compensatory leave provided by an employer that the employee elects to use for medical leave under this chapter
      shall count against the sixteen (16) workweeks of allowable medical leave provided by the DCFMLA.</span>
