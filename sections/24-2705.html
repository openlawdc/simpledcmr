                    <span class="" style="">A full investigation may be initiated when there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the persons, groups, or organizations to be investigated are planning or engaged in criminal activity that would threaten public safety or the security of the
      city. A full investigation may be conducted to prevent, solve or prosecute such criminal activity.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Reasonable suspicion is a belief based on articulable facts and circumstances indicating a past, current, or impending violation of law. The reasonable suspicion standard is lower than the standard of probable cause; however, a mere hunch is insufficient
      as a basis for reasonable suspicion. A suspicion that is based upon the race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, lawful political affiliation or activity, or lawful news-gathering activity of an individual or group is not a reasonable suspicion.
      In determining whether there is reasonable suspicion of a criminal act an investigator may take into account any facts or circumstances that a prudent investigator would consider.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">The standard for opening a full investigation is satisfied where there is not yet a current substantive or preparatory criminal act, but there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the persons, groups, or organizations to be investigated are planning
