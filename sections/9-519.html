      ($ 100,000). On January 15, 1990, A sells her stock to D for three hundred thousand dollars ($ 300,000). On June 20, 1990, X renovates the real property, which increases the estimated fair market value to one million nine hundred thousand dollars
      ($ 1,900,000). On August 4, 1990, B sells his stock to D for five hundred thousand dollars ($ 500,000). The transfer from B to D is a transfer of a controlling interest. The portion of the consideration of A&amp;#8217;s transfer to D that is subject
      to the recordation tax is two hundred seventy thousand dollars ($ 270,000). One-tenth (1/10) of the value of the assets at the time of the sale, thirty thousand dollars ($ 30,000), is attributable to non-real property assets, therefore, one-tenth
      (1/10) of the purchase price of the stock is excluded from the tax. The portion of the consideration of B&amp;#8217;s sale to D that is subject to the tax is four hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($ 475,000). One-twentieth (1/20) of the purchase
      price of the stock at the time of sale, twenty-five thousand dollars ($ 25,000), is attributable to assets other than real property and is excluded from the tax.</span>
