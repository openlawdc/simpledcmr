      during cleaning of parts or theaddition or removal of solvent. For remote reservoir cold cleaningmachines that drain directly into the solvent storage reservoir, aperforated drain with a diameter of not more than six inches (6in.) shall constitute
      an acceptable cover. Â 764.4 Coldcleaning machines shall be operated in accordance with thefollowing procedures: Â (a) Waste solvent shall be collectedand stored in closed containers. The closed containers may containa device that allows pressure
      relief, but does not allow liquidsolvent to drain from the container; Â (b) Cleaned parts shallbe drained at least fifteen (15) seconds or until dripping ceases,whichever is longer; (1) Parts having cavities or blind holes shallbe tipped or rotated
      while the part is draining; and (2) During thedraining, tipping or rotating, the parts shall be positioned sothat solvent drains directly back to the cold cleaning machine;Â (c) Flushing of parts using a flexible hose or otherflushing device shall
      be performed only within the freeboard areaof the cold cleaning machine. The solvent spray shall be a solidfluid stream, not an atomized or shower spray, at a pressure thatdoes not exceed ten pounds (10 lb.) per square inch gauge (psig);Â (d) The
      owner or operator shall ensure that when the coveris open, the cold cleaning machine is not exposed to drafts greaterthan forty meters (40 m.) per minute (one hundred thirty-two feet(132 ft.) per minute), as measured between one meter (1 m.) and
      twometers (2 m.) (three and three tenths feet (3.3 ft.) and six andsix tenths feet (6.6 ft.) upwind, and at the same elevation as thetank lip; Â (e) Sponges, fabric, wood, leather, paperproducts, and other absorbent materials shall not be cleaned
      in thecold cleaning machine; Â (f) When a pumpagitated solvent bathis used, the agitator shall be operated to produce a rolling motionof the solvent with no observable splashing of the solvent againstthe tank walls or the parts being cleaned. Air-agitated
      solventbaths may not be used; Â (g) Spills during solvent transferand use of the cold cleaning machine shall be cleaned upimmediately, and the wipe rags or other absorbent materials shallbe immediately stored in covered containers for disposal orrecycling;
      Â (h) Work area fans shall be located andpositioned so that they do not blow across the opening of thedegreaser unit; and Â (i) The owner or operator shall ensurethat the solvent level does not exceed the fill line. 764.5 Anysolvent for use in a
      cold cleaning machine shall not have a vaporpressure of one millimeter of mercury (1.0 mm. Hg) or greater,measured at twenty degrees Celsius (20o C) or sixty-eight degreesFahrenheit (68Â° F) containing VOCs; 764.6 A person whosells or offers for
      sale any solvent containing VOCs for use in acold cleaning machine shall provide the following writteninformation to the purchaser: (a) The name and address of thesolvent supplier; Â (b) The type of solvent, including theproduct or vendor identification
      number; and Â (c) The vaporpressure of the solvent, measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg)at twenty degrees Celsius (20o C) or sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit(68Â° F); and Â 764.7 A person who operates a coldcleaning machine shall maintain for
      not less than two (2) years andshall provide to the Department, on request, the informationspecified in Â§ 764.6. An invoice, bill of sale,certificate that corresponds to a number of sales, Material SafetyData Sheet (MSDS), or other appropriate
