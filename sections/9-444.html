Sales Tax Act (<a href='http://www.govtrack.us/search?q=public%20law%2081-76'>P.L. 81-76</a>, 5-27-49). Those provisions
        were repealed and the § 128 exemption added by §§ 301 and 302 of D.C, Law 1-23 (&amp;#8220;Revenue Act of 1975&amp;#8243;). The changes were reflected in both the 1978 Supp. V and 1981 Ed. of the D.C. Code However, the changes made by <a href='http://openlims.org/public/L1-23.pdf'>D.C. Law
        1-23</a> (the repeal of the sales tax on these items) were later repealed by §§ 401-407 of <a href='http://openlims.org/public/L1-70.pdf'>D.C. Law 1-70</a>, the &amp;#8220;Revenue Act of 1976.&amp;#8221; The restoration of the original provisions was not properly codified by the Congressional staff
        then responsible for the D.C. Code. The errors were not corrected in the 1981 Edition of the D.C. Code, but will be corrected in the 1982 Supplement.</span>
