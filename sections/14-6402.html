        a result of its recertification process. To determine whether a dwelling unit is too small or too large, DCHA shall use the occupancy standards outlined at chapter 61 of this Title. If DCHA approves a tenant’s request for transfer, the household
        must transfer as one unit. The DCHA will not split families.</span>
