      machine openings when in place, isfree of cracks, holes, and other defects, and can be readily openedor closed without disturbing the vapor zone; (1) If the solventcleaning machine opening is greater than ten square feet (10 sq.ft.), the cover must
      be powered; and (2) If a lip exhaust is used,the closed cover shall be below the level of the lip exhaust;Â (b) Sides that result in a freeboard ratio greater than orequal to seventy-five one hundredths (0.75); Â (c) A safetyswitch (thermostat and

      vapors through a properly operated and maintainedcarbon adsorber such that the concentration of organic solvent inthe exhaust does not exceed one hundred parts per million (100ppm); and Â (j) A permanent, conspicuous label summarizing theoperating
      requirements found in Â§ 765.5. Â 765.3 Inaddition to the requirements in Â§ 765.2, the operator ofa batch vapor cleaning machine with a solvent/air interface area ofthirteen square feet (13 sq. ft.) or less shall use one of thefollowing devices
      or strategies: Â (a) A working mode cover,freeboard ratio of one (1.0), and superheated vapor; Â (b) Afreeboard refrigeration device operated to ensure that the chilledair blanket temperature is no greater than thirty percent (30%) ofthe solventâ€™s
      boiling point and superheatedvapor; Â (c) A working mode cover and a freeboardrefrigeration device operated to ensure that the chilled airblanket temperature is no greater than thirty percent (30%) of thesolventâ€™s boiling point; Â (d) Reduced
      roomdraft, freeboard ratio of one (1.0), and superheated vapor; Â(e) A freeboard refrigeration device operated to ensure that thechilled air blanket temperature is no greater than thirty percent(30%) of the solventâ€™s boiling point and reducedroom
      draft; Â (f) A freeboard refrigeration device operated toensure that the chilled air blanket temperature is no greater thanthirty percent (30%) of the solventâ€™s boilingpoint and a freeboard ratio of one (1.0); Â (g) A freeboardrefrigeration device
      operated to ensure that the chilled airblanket temperature is no greater than thirty percent (30%) of thesolventâ€™s boiling point and dwell. Dwell shallbe not less than thirty-five percent (35%) of the dwell timedetermined for the part or parts;
      Â (h) Reduced room draft,dwell, and a freeboard ratio of one (1.0); Â (i) A freeboardrefrigeration device operated to ensure that the chilled airblanket temperature is no greater than thirty percent (30%) of thesolventâ€™s boiling point and a carbon
      adsorberwhich reduces solvent emissions in the exhaust to a level not toexceed one hundred parts per million (100 ppm) at any time; and (j)A freeboard ratio of one (1.0), superheated vapor, and a carbonadsorber which reduces solvent emissions in
      the exhaust to a levelnot to exceed one hundred parts per million (100 ppm) at any time.Â 765.4 In addition to the requirements of Â§ 765.2,the operator of a batch vapor cleaning machine with a solvent/airinterface area of greater than thirteen
      square feet (13 sq. ft.)shall use one of the following devices or strategies: Â (a) Afreeboard refrigeration device operated to ensure that the chilledair blanket temperature is no greater than thirty percent (30%) ofthe solventâ€™s boiling point,
      a freeboard ratioof one (1.0), and superheated vapor; Â (b) Dwell and afreeboard refrigeration device operated to ensure that the chilledair blanket temperature is no greater than thirty percent (30%) ofthe solventâ€™s boiling point, and reduced
      roomdraft. Dwell shall be not less than thirty-five percent (35%) ofthe dwell time determined for the part or parts; Â (c) Aworking mode cover and a freeboard refrigeration device operated toensure that the chilled air blanket temperature is no
      greater thanthirty percent (30%) of the solventâ€™s boilingpoint and superheated vapor; Â (d) Reduced room draft,freeboard ratio of one (1.0), and superheated vapor; Â (e) Afreeboard refrigeration device operated to ensure that the chilledair blanket
      temperature is no greater than thirty percent (30%) ofthe solventâ€™s boiling point, reduced room draft,and superheated vapor; Â (f) A freeboard refrigeration deviceoperated to ensure that the chilled air blanket temperature is nogreater than thirty
      percent (30%) of thesolventâ€™s boiling point, reduced room draft, anda freeboard ratio of one (1.0); or Â (g) A freeboardrefrigeration device operated to ensure that the chilled airblanket temperature is no greater than thirty percent (30%) of
      thesolventâ€™s boiling point, superheated vapor, anda carbon adsorber, which reduces solvent emissions in the exhaustto a level not to exceed one hundred parts per million (100 ppm) atany time. Â 765.5 Batch vapor cleaning machines shall beoperated
      in accordance with the following procedures: Â (a)Waste solvent, still bottoms, and sump bottoms shall be collectedand stored in closed containers. The closed containers may containa device that allows pressure relief but does not allow liquidsolvent
      to drain from the container; Â (b) Cleaned parts shallbe drained at least fifteen (15) seconds or until dripping ceases,whichever is longer: (1) Parts having cavities or blind holes shallbe tipped or rotated while the part is draining; and (2) Asuperheated
      vapor system shall be an acceptable alternatetechnology; Â (c) Parts baskets or parts shall not be removedfrom the batch vapor cleaning machine until dripping has ceased;Â (d) Flushing or spraying of parts using a flexible hose orother flushing
      device shall be performed within the vapor zone ofthe batch vapor cleaning machine or within a section of the machinethat is not exposed to the ambient air. The solvent spray shall bea solid fluid stream, not an atomized or shower spray; Â (e)When
      the cover is open, the batch vapor cleaning machine shall notbe exposed to drafts greater than forty meters (40 m.) per minute(one hundred thirty-two feet (132 ft.) per minute), as measuredbetween one meter (1 m.) and two meters (2 m.) (three and
      threetenths feet (3.3 ft.) and six and six tenths feet (6.6 ft.) upwindand at the same elevation as the tank lip; Â (f) Sponges,fabric, wood, leather, paper products, and other absorbentmaterials shall not be cleaned in the batch vapor cleaning
      machine;Â (g) Spills during solvent transfer and use of the batchvapor cleaning machine shall be cleaned up immediately or themachine shall be shut down. Wipe rags or other absorbent materialsshall be immediately stored in covered containers for
      disposal orrecycling; Â (h) Work area fans shall be located andpositioned so that they do not blow across the opening of the batchvapor cleaning machine; Â (i) During startup of the batchvapor cleaning machine the primary condenser shall be turned
      onbefore the sump heater; Â (j) During shutdown of the batchvapor cleaning machine, the sump heater shall be turned off and thesolvent vapor layer allowed to collapse before the primarycondenser is turned off; Â (k) When solvent is added to ordrained
      from the batch vapor cleaning machine, the solvent shall betransferred using threaded or other leak proof couplings and theend of the pipe in the solvent sump shall be located beneath theliquid solvent surface; Â (l) The working and downtime coversshall
      be closed at all times except during parts entry and exitfrom the machine, during maintenance of the machine when thesolvent has been removed, and during addition of solvent to themachine; and Â (m) If a lip exhaust is used on the open topvapor
      degreaser, the ventilation rate shall not exceed twentymeters cubed per minute per meters squared (20 m.3/min./m.2) orsixty-five feet cubed per minute per feet squared (65ft.3/min./ft.2) of degreaser open area, unless a higher rate isnecessary to
      meet federal Occupational Safety &amp;#038; HealthAdministration (OSHA) requirements. SOURCE: Notice of FinalRulemaking published at <a href='http://www.dcregs.dc.gov/Gateway/IssueList.aspx?IssueYear=2011'>58 DCR 11286</a>, 11374 (December 30,2011).</span>
