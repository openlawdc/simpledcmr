      The records, whichshall be maintained for not less thanwo (2) years, shall include,at a minimum, the quantity of solvent added to andemoved from thesolvent cleaning machine, and the dates of the additionndremoval. Â 768.3 If the cleaning machine
      has a solvent/airinterface, thewner or operator shall: Â (a) Maintain a logof solvent additions and deletionsor each solvent cleaningmachine; and Â (b) Ensure that emissions from eacholventcleaning machine are equal to or less than the applicable

      is less than orequal to two and ninety-five one hundredths cubic meters2.95m.3), the emission limit shall be determined using Table I inÂ§ 767.3 orhe equation in Â§ 768.6. If thetable is used, and the cleaning capacity ofhe cleaning machinefalls
      between two cleaning capacity sizes, then the lower ofhetwo (2) emission limits applies; 768.6 For cleaning machines with acleaningapacity that is greater than two and ninety-five onehundredths cubic meters2.95 m.3), the emission limit shall bedetermined
      using the following equation: EL = 330 (vol)0.6Â where: Â EL = the three (3) month rolling averagemonthlymission limit (kilograms/month); vol = the cleaningcapacity of machine (cubiceters); Â 768.7 Each owner oroperator of a batch vapor or inline

      exceedances shall be reportedto the District within thirty (30) days of theetermination of theexceedance. 768.8 The owner or operator of a batch vapor orn-linesolvent cleaning machine shall maintain records and determinecompliancen accordance with
      the following: (a) On the firstoperating day of every monthnsure that the solvent cleaningmachine system contains only clean liquidolvent; (1) Thisincludes, but is not limited to, fresh unused solvent,ecycledsolvent, and used solvent that has been
      cleaned of soils; (2) Afill lineust be indicated during the first month the measurementsare made; (3) Theolvent level within the machine must be returnedto the same fill-line eachonth, immediately before calculatingmonthly emissions; and (4) The
      solventleaning machine does nothave to be emptied and filled with fresh unused solventefore thecalculations. (b) Using the records of all solvent additionsnddeletions for the previous monthly reporting period, determinesolventmissions using one
      (1) of the following equations: (1) Forcleaning machinesith a solvent/air interface: Â Âwhere: Â E = the total halogenated HAPolvent emissions fromthe solvent cleaning machine during the most recentonthlyreporting period (kilograms of solvent per
