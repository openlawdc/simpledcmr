      approval of a permit as far in advance as is practical. The purpose of the notice and permit approval process is to avoid situations where more than one group seeks to use the same space at the same time. Early submission gives the Chief of Police
      or his or her designee and the applicant the maximum time to resolve any issues that may arise, and minimizes the possibility that an approved permit will already have been issued to another group for the desired time and place. It also provides
      the Metropolitan Police Department and other District agencies the ability to provide appropriate police protection, traffic control, and other support for participants and other individuals.</span>
