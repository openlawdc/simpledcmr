        the qualified employees are affected by the restrictions of § 1103.3. The annual payroll each year for the 10 qualified employees is $400,000. For tax years 2001 and 2002, Company D is entitled to a tax credit equal to 10% of the annual salaries

        1103.1 applies to the 5-entry level qualified employees and the limitation of § 1103.2 applies to the highly skilled qualified employees. Therefore, Company D is entitled to a tax credit of $40,000, calculated as follows: (1) the total annual
        wages paid to the entry level qualified employees is $150,000 of which 10%, or $15,000, is available for the credit, (2) the total annual wages paid to the highly skilled qualified employees is $350,000 and since the credit for each of the five
        highly skilled qualified employee exceeds $5,000, only $25,000 is available for the credit, (3) $15,000 plus $25,000 totals $40,000.</span>
