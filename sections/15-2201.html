                    <span class="" style="">Procurement Planning. Procurement planning is the process of selecting the appropriate method of satisfying a Commission need considering the value, complexity, and schedule of the requirement. The procurement planning process should be a team effort

                    <span class="" style="">Market Research. Commission representatives should engage in market research to the extent necessary to conduct effective procurements and to develop qualified sources to fulfill Commission requirements. Market research should include, but not be
      limited to, an assessment of the market conditions and the technology relating to the requirement as well as an evaluation of the experience of other customers of the required product or service. Market research should be used to help ensure that
      an adequate pool of qualified firms is available to compete for Commission requirements. Market research techniques include publishing requests for information (RFIs), holding presolicitation conferences, conducting Internet searches, and attendance
      by Commission personnel at seminars and symposia.</span>

The Equal Opportunity for Local, Small, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Act of 1999, <a href='http://openlims.org/public/L12-268.pdf'>D.C. Law 12-268</a>, establishes a fifty (50) percent goal for D.C. government contracts with local small business enterprises and provides
      a preference for local and disadvantaged businesses in all areas of D.C. government contracting. Commission representatives are required to plan and onduct procurements in a manner to help achieve this goal, as follows:</span>

                    <span class="" style="">To enhance supplier diversity the Commission may establish partnership, teaming, or mentor-protege programs in which established firms are encouraged to team with local, small and disadvantaged enterprises to provide supplies or services to satisfy
        Commission requirements. The program would include incentive provisions, as specified by the Commission, to reward established firms for helping local, small and disadvantaged enterprises qualify as responsible contractors with the Commission;</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Obtaining Competition. The Commission, and its Contracting Officer(s) operating within the limits of their delegations, shall conduct procurements in a manner that solicits and encourages maximum practicable competition. This effort shall include
      encouraging Commission staff to describe their needs in terms that foster competition including, whenever possible, the use of performance-based specifications and statements of work (SOWs). For purchases at or below the simplified acquisition ceiling,
      it shall be sufficient for the Contracting Officer to obtain three quotations. For purchases of $ 2,500 or less, competition is preferred but not required. For purchases above the simplified acquisition ceiling, the Contracting Officer shall obtain
      maximum practical competition.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Source Lists. To the extent feasible, the Contracting Officer will maintain a source list of qualified contractors by type of supply or service for use in obtaining competition. When a source list for a class of supplies or services becomes too large
      for effective solicitation of all the listed firms, the Commission or the Contracting Officer may use a part of the list for an individual solicitation. In such cases, for each subsequent procurement of the particular class of supplies or services,
      the Commission or the Contracting Officer shall rotate the list to ensure that firms not previously solicited will have an opportunity to compete.</span>
