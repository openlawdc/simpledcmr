      managed care provider or its successors to recover any payments made while the prepaid, capitated provider operated without insurance. The Department may also use the prepaid, capitated provider’s deposit to obtain coverage for AFDC or AFDC-related
      recipients while the prepaid, capitated provider is operating without the required insurance.</span>
