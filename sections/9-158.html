      group of business entities that are sufficiently interdependent, integrated, and interrelated through their activities so as to provide synergy and mutual benefit that produces a sharing or exchange of value among them and a significant flow of
      value to the separate parts. Under D.C. Official Code § 47-1801.04(55)(A), the definition of “unitary business” shall be construed to the broadest extent permitted by the U.S. Constitution.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">158.10   Evidence of unitary business factors.  The determination of whether or not the operations of business segments are a unitary business will turn on the facts and circumstances of the case.  Several factors may evidence that the operations
      of business segments are a unitary business.  Generally, several functionally integrating factors will exist in a unitary business, although a unitary business may exist as a result of few factors or even one (1) factor, if the factor or factors
      involved are particularly significant.  In determining whether a unitary business exists, factors should not be examined in isolation.  Instead, it should be determined whether the factors which are present, in combination, result in a functionally
      integrated business.  The presence or absence of any one (1) factor or any particular factors is not necessarily determinative as to whether a unitary business exists, although absence of all of the factors will generally result in a finding that
      a unitary business does not exist.</span>

      processing of a natural resource and the subsequent sale of a product based upon the extracted natural resource, is engaged in a single unitary business, regardless of the fact that the various steps in the process are operated substantially independently

                    <span class="" style="">Strong centralized management. Business activities which might otherwise be considered as part of more than one (1) unitary business may constitute one (1) unitary business when there is a strong central management, coupled with the existence of
        centralized departments for such functions as financing, advertising, research, or purchasing. Strong centralized management exists when a central manager or group of managers makes substantially all of the operational decisions of the business.
        For example, some businesses conducting diverse lines of business may properly be considered as engaged in only one (1) unitary business when the central executive officers are actively involved in the operations of the various business activities
        and there are centralized offices which perform for the business activities the normal matters which a truly independent business would perform for itself, such as personnel, purchasing, advertising, financing, or research and development.</span>
