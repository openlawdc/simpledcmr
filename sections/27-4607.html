                    <span class="" style="">Organizational conflicts of interests can arise in a variety of circumstances. For example, a contractor that develops the technical specifications for an item that will be the subject of a future procurement may have an incentive to develop specifications
      favoring its own products unless it is barred from participating in the future procurement. Another example is a case where a contractor performs services for the Hospital that require access to non-public information (for example, proprietary data
      of other companies) and could therefore gain an unfair advantage over competitors in future procurements.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">A number of measures may be appropriate for eliminating or mitigating organizational conflicts of interest, and the Contracting Officer has broad discretion to select the approach that is most suitable in any particular case. For example, a contract
      to assist the Hospital in developing requirements for a future procurement ordinarily should include a clause prohibiting the contractor from participating in the future procurement. A contract in which the contractor gains access to proprietary
      information of other companies (or non-public information on the Hospital’s procurement plans) should include an appropriate clause that prevents the contractor from using such information in any manner that might give it an unfair advantage and
      prohibits the contractor from disclosing this proprietary information.</span>
