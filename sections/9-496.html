      sales tax of 10% (&amp;#8220;the 10% sales tax&amp;#8221;) is the sum of the general sales tax of 5.75% imposed by D.C. Official Code §47-2002, plus an additional sales tax of 4.25%. D.C. Official Code § 47-2002, 2002.05(b), (d)(2).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Answer 5: Yes. D.C. Official Code § 47-2002.05(b) and (d)(2) requires the Team, the Commission, or any other person described in Answer 2, to collect the tax on the gross receipts that it derives from selling tickets to any public event at the Ballpark,
      regardless of whether the tickets are sold to a person who resells the tickets to another person. Therefore, D.C. Official Code §47-2001(n)(1) (which exempts from sales tax certain sales of tangible personal property intended for resale) does not
      apply to the above sales.</span>

      $10 of sales tax, and pays the $110 to the Team. How much of the $110 received by the Team from the agent is subject to sales tax?</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Answer 6: Under District law the $10 of tax is not subject to sales tax. D.C. Official Code §47- 2001(p)(2)(D). Thus, the Team must pay a 10% sales tax only on the $100 and must pay to the District the $10 of sales tax received from the agent.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Question 7: Assume the same facts as in question 6, except that the Team pays the agent a commission in exchange for the agent&amp;#8217;s services. Does District law levy the 10% sales tax on the total gross receipts from ticket sales made by the
      agent or on those receipts less the commission paid to the agent?</span>

                <p>
                
                    <span class="" style="">Answer 7: District tax regulations provide that discounts allowed to a sales agent as compensation for ticket sales are selling expenses. Therefore, the Team cannot deduct discounts and similar compensation in determining the amount of gross receipts
      subject to sales tax. See D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 9, §430.4(1998). Thus, District law levies the 10% sales tax on the total gross receipts derived by the Team from the sale of the tickets without any reduction for the agent&amp;#8217;s commission.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Question 8: Assume that the agent has a contract with the Team to sell tickets and to receive a 5% commission from the Team on the gross receipts from the sale. For purposes of calculating the agent&amp;#8217;s commission, gross receipts from the
      sale of the tickets do not include the tax included in the price of the tickets. The agent sells the tickets for a total price of $110 which includes $10 of sales tax (10% of $100). The agent retains $5 as its commission (5% of $100) and pays $105
      to the Team. What are the total gross receipts subject to the sales tax, and how much sales tax must be paid by the Team?</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Answer 8: The total gross receipts subject to the 10% sales tax are $100, and therefore, the Team must pay $10 (10% of $100) of sales tax to the District.</span>

      the corporation buy season tickets for the ten seats at a cost of $81,000 ($100 face value per ticket x 10 seats x 81 games). On what amounts does District law impose the 10% tax on tickets?</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Answer 10: The 10% sales tax on tickets applies only to the $81,000. No sales tax applies to the remaining $30,000 of gross proceeds because that amount is not paid for the right to enter the Ballpark. See D.C. Official Code § 47-2002.05(a)(4) (defining
      the term &amp;#8220;ticket&amp;#8221;). Instead, the $30,000 is for the long-term right to use real property, the suite. District law only imposes sales tax on the proceeds from leases of &amp;#8220;tangible personal property,&amp;#8221; not real
      property. See D.C. Official Code §47-2001(n)(1)(F).</span>

      designated by the corporation to be admitted to the Ballpark for each game during the MLB season? Does the term &amp;#8220;ticket&amp;#8221; include the right to enter the Ballpark as a result of licensing a private suite at the Ballpark?</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Answer 11: Yes. D.C. Official Code § 47-2002.05 (a)(4). The 10% sales tax on ticket sales applies to that portion of the gross receipts received by the Team from selling, leasing, or licensing private suites at the Ballpark that are attributable to
      the face value of the admission tickets for seats in those suites.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">For example, assume that the face value of an admission ticket for a seat in that suite is $100 per game. Since the Team will play 81 homes games at the Ballpark during the regular season, the amount of gross receipts subject to the 10% sales tax
      will be $81,000 (10 seats x $100 per game x 81 games). The Team would collect and pay over this sales tax to the District. No sales tax applies to the remaining $30,000 of gross proceeds because those proceeds are not paid for the right to enter
      the Ballpark.</span>

      does not expand the scope of services subject to the sales tax to include electronic displays of advertisers&amp;#8217; messages. Therefore, the gross receipts received by the Team from displaying electronically an advertiser&amp;#8217;s message

      the designated areas include the outfield fences, certain stadium walls, and other permanent structures erected intentionally for the purpose of displaying the signs. Either the advertiser or the Team installs the signs in the designated areas.

                    <span class="" style="">Answer 15: The signs are tangible personal property. By paying the Team, the advertiser obtains the right to use space to display the signs in designated areas of the Ballpark that qualify as real property. District law only imposes sales tax on gross
      receipts derived from renting or leasing tangible personal property. Since the Team is renting real property rather than tangible personal property, the Team is not subject to sales tax on gross receipts received from advertisers to display signs

                    <span class="" style="">Answer 16: The temporary structures are not real property but other tangible personal property. Gross receipts received for the right to display advertising on these temporary structures are payments for the right to use (rent) space on the temporary

                    <span class="" style="">Answer 17: Before the passage of the Act, District law did not impose its sales tax on gross receipts from the sale of advertising space in game-day programs. Instead, it levied the sales tax on gross receipts from sales to the ultimate consumer of
      programs containing that advertising. D.C. Mun. Regs. tit.9, §452.3 (1998). The Act does not change this result. Therefore, District law requires the Team to pay the 10% Ballpark sales tax on gross receipts from sales of game- day programs but not

      is promoting a Commission Event, then the Commission must comply with this requirement.</span>
