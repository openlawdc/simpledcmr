        may be the basis for an exemption to this rule. A lottery sales agent requesting an exemption for a legal impediment will not be required to formally seek a zoning variance to establish such impediment, but will be required to document that they
        have applied for and have been refused whatever permit(s) are necessary to remove the identified barrier(s).</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Landlord refusal. An exemption may be granted based on the refusal of a landlord to grant permission to a sales agent to make improvements required by the Agency under this rule or based on the refusal of a landlord to pay for improvements required
        by the Agency under this rule. To request such an exemption, the sales agent must submit documentation to the Executive Director that the sales agent requested the landlord&amp;#8217;s permission and financial participation to make the required
        structural improvements, that such request was denied by the landlord, and the reasons for the denial. In making a decision on the exemption request, the Executive Director shall take into consideration, but not be limited to, the sufficiency
        of the reasons provided by the landlord for denying the sales agent&amp;#8217;s request.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Undue financial hardship. A limited exemption may be granted if a sales agent can demonstrate that the cost of removing a structural barrier or of making the required structural modification(s) to the sales agent&amp;#8217;s facility is an undue
        financial hardship in that the cost of making such a change(s) exceeds 25% of the sales agent&amp;#8217;s compensation from the lottery for the prior calendar year (An annualized sales figure based upon the sales agent&amp;#8217;s most current
        13-week sales period shall be used for those sales agent locations with less than a full year&amp;#8217;s history of sales.) Under the terms of this limited exemption, a sales agent would be required to annually make those improvements and modifications
        that can be financed within an amount that is approximately equal to 25% of the total compensation earned from the Agency in the prior calendar year. This requirement would continue on a year-to-year basis until all the improvements and modifications
        required by this rule have been completed. A sales agent shall provide all supporting documentation requested by the Executive Director to substantiate the cost estimates of making the required improvements to the sales agent&amp;#8217;s location.</span>

        the Agency may have the barrier removal action evaluated by a person knowledgeable in accessibility codes and construction to determine the merits of the claim.</span>
