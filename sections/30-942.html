      and depositing on behalf of the prize winner the required federal and jurisdictional withholding taxes (if any) on the “gross prize value” and the Lottery pays the prizewinner the residual amount (subject to any setoff requirements). Grand Prize
      winners will receive a Withholding Taxes Paid prize determined after deducting all applicable withholding taxes regardless of the “Advertised Grand Prize Amount”, and which may be higher or lower than the “Advertised Grand Prize amount. Federal
      and jurisdictional withholding tax rates are subject to change and will be determined at the time the prize is awarded.</span>

      to the federal and jurisdictional authorities (if any) on behalf of the prize winner. The Lottery and MUSL Product Group are not responsible for additional income or other taxes applicable in excess of the amount withheld and remitted by the Lottery
      that may be due when the prizewinner files all tax returns for the year the prize is claimed; Prizewinners should verify personal tax liability with a financial adviser.</span>

      will withhold and remit $762,500.00 in federal tax withholding, $183,000.00 in jurisdictional tax withholding and pay the prize winner $2,104,500.00 in a single cash prize payment (subject to any setoff requirements); at the end of the tax year
      the Lottery will communicate to the prizewinner a W-2G Form showing prize won of $3,050,000.00.</span>
