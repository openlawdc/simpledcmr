                    <span class="" style="">Contracts with District Agencies &amp;#8211; The CCO or designee may authorize Contracting Officers to place orders with any department, office, or agency of the District for materials, supplies, equipment, work, or services of any kind that the requisitioned
      department, office, or agency may be in a position to supply or equipped to render. The Hospital placing any such orders shall either advance, subject to proper adjustment on the basis of actual cost, or reimburse, such department, office or agency
      the actual cost of materials, supplies, or equipment furnished or work or services performed as determined by such department, office, or agency as may be requisitioned. Orders placed as provided in this subsection shall be considered as obligations
      upon appropriations in the same manner as orders or contracts placed with private contractors.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">Letter Contracts &amp;#8211; A letter contract may be used only after the Contracting Officer determines, in writing, that no other type of contract is suitable. A letter contract shall not commit the Hospital to a definitive contract in excess of
      the funds available at the time the letter contract is executed. The Contracting Officer may use a letter contract when the Hospital’s interests demand that the contractor be given a binding commitment so that work can start immediately and executing
      a definitive contract is not possible in sufficient time to meet the requirement. Each letter contract shall be as complete and definite as possible under the circumstances and shall include clauses approved and required by the CCO.</span>

                    <span class="" style="">When a letter contract is executed, the Contracting Officer shall include a price ceiling for the anticipated definitive contract. The price ceiling shall not be exceeded. Each letter contract shall also include a clause indicating the maximum liability
      of the Hospital under the letter contract. The maximum liability to the Hospital shall be the estimated amount necessary to cover the contractor&amp;#8217;s requirement for funds before execution of the definitive contract. The Contracting Officer
      may execute a definitive contract after the date of execution of the letter contract. Prior to execution of a letter contract, the Contracting Officer shall ensure that funds are encumbered for obligation in the amount of the maximum Hospital liability
      for the term of the letter contract. For purposes of review and approval of letter contracts, and for purposes of contracting authority, the Contracting Officer shall use the estimated cost of the definitive contract for determining the type and
      level of review and approval required.</span>
