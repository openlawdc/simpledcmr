      in events material to the inquiry from a non-neutral perspective; being a party to the inquiry or having the potential of providing information relevant to the inquiry; or having a financial interest in the outcome of the inquiry.</span>

      point at which the individual filing the challenge becomes aware of potential personal conflict of the Member or prior to the reported violation being considered by the Board, whichever is earlier. The challenge must describe in detail the basis

      or otherwise removes himself/herself from the particular inquiry, the Chair shall notify the challenged Member and remove the Member from that inquiry. If a challenge to a Member is rejected under the above procedure, the written challenge and the
      Member&amp;#8217;s written response, as well as the official minutes of the meeting at which the matter was considered, shall be incorporated in the investigative file as part of the record.</span>
