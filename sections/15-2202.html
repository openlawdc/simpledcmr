      will be conducted by the Commission or, under the Commission&amp;#8217;s delegation, through the Contracting Officer and the appropriate procurement team. The purpose of these discussions is to improve the evaluation team&amp;#8217;s understanding

      for all costs and resulting profit or loss under the contract to the contractor. The Commission or the Contracting Officer, after consulting with the Commission, may waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis. Other contract types providing
      for price adjustments, escalation, or payment on a cost reimbursement basis may be authorized when in the best interest of the Commission. When contract types other than firm-fixed price are authorized, the Commission or the Contracting Officer
      shall ensure that adequate terms and conditions are included to protect the interests of the Commission when adjustments in price are required. Such terms include adjustments tied to nationally recognized indexes and access to contractor accounting
      data regarding cost of performance.</span>

      are exempt from publication and may be awarded using limited factors and streamlined procedures. The award of a task order under a multiple award task-order contract is exempt from the protest procedures of these regulations.</span>
