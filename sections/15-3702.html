      appliance heat, steam or noise, gas blowing or hissing, second call, or pressure alarm, or presents an immediate or probable hazard to persons or property and requires immediate repair or continuous action until the conditions are no longer hazardous
      within fifty (50) minutes after the utility’s dispatch has been informed about the leak and/or odor complaint during business or non-business hours. The natural gas utility shall respond to (be at the site of) all gas leaks or customer reported
      odor complaint calls involving a “medium” gas leak, noise, or a leak that is recognized as being non-hazardous at the time of detection, but requires scheduled repair based on probable future hazard, within sixty (60) minutes after the utility’s
      dispatch has been informed about the leak and/or odor complaint during business or non-business hours. For gas leaks and customer reported odor complaint calls involving a “slight” gas leak, or a leak that is non-hazardous at the time of detection
      and can be reasonably expected to remain non-hazardous, a response shall involve making a determination as to the severity of the gas leaks and/or reported odor complaints and indicating to the customer/caller when a representative will be at the
      site, but not later than ninety-five (95) minutes after the utility’s dispatch has been informed about the leak and/or odor complaint during business and non-business hours. The natural gas utility shall provide the results to OE and OPC on a semi-annual

      about and determined that the odor complaint resulted from a leak and/or the dispatch has determined that a leak has occurred on the utility’s gas system, with as much detailed information as possible. To the extent all information required by Section
      3702.5 is not available at the time of the initial communication, the natural gas utility shall within two (2) hours of the dispatch supplement its initial report with the additional information. Gas leaks found inside customers’ facilities and
